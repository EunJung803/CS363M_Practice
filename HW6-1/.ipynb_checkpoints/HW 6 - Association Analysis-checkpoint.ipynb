    "# Association Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Association analysis uses machine learning to extract frequent itemsets and strong association rules from large datasets. In this assignment you'll be implementing one of the most commonly used algorithms for association rule mining - the Apriori algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset (`large_retail.txt`) that we are going to use has been adapted from the [Retail Market Basket Dataset](http://fimi.ua.ac.be/data/retail.pdf). This dataset contains transaction records supplied by a Belgian retail supermarket store. Each line in the file represents a separate transaction with the item ids separated by space. The dataset has 3000 transactions and 99 different item ids.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are also provided with a smaller dataset (`small_retail.txt`) with 9 transactions and 5 different item ids along with the solutions. You can test and debug your implementation on this smaller dataset."

    "## Apriori Algorithm from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "The Apriori algorithm is a classical algorithm in data mining. It is used for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules. In this part, you'll be implementing this algorithm for generating the itemsets that occur enough times to meet the `min_sup` threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Hint:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the `frozenset` data structure in Python, which is similar to `set` in functionality, to represent the itemsets, because `frozenset` is an immutable (hashable) data structure. You can maintain a dictionary that maps from the itemset (a `frozenset`) to its support count."

    "`scikit-learn` does not provide any functionality for association rule mining so for this assignment you will be using the `MLxtend` library. The documentation for this library is available [here](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to install the `MLxtend` library. There are several ways of doing this; you can follow the instructions below, or see the setup guide  [here](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/installation/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "If you downladed Anaconda in order to get Jupyter Notebooks (which is the most common way to get Jupyter Notebooks), then you will want to install `MLxtend` using Conda. \n",
    "\n",
    "Open a command prompt / terminal window and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install mlxtend --channel conda-forge`\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyPi\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also install via pip. \n",
    "Note: If you are running Jupyter notebooks through an Anaconda install, then pip may not place the `MLxtend` libraries in the correct place for use in Jupyter (which is why you should use Conda instead of pip, if you downloaded Anaconda).\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a command prompt / terminal window and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip3 install mlxtend`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Google Colab, you can install MLXtend via a pip install command with an exclamation point in front of it, in one of your notebook cells. The exclamation points allows you to put shell commands inside of Colab. \n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "For the second part of this assignment, the data we'll use comes from a bakery called \"The Bread Basket\", located in the historic center of Edinburgh. The dataset contains more than 9000 transactions from the bakery. The file contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Date. Categorical variable that tells us the date of the transactions (YYYY-MM-DD format). The column includes dates from 2016-10-30 to 2017-04-09.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time. Categorical variable that tells us the time of the transactions (HH:MM:SS format).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transaction. Quantitative variable that allows us to differentiate the transactions. The rows that share the same value in this field belong to the same transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Item. Categorical variable with the products purchased.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, you'll be running the Apriori algorithm from the MLxtend library to generate the itemsets that occur more than the `min_sup` threshold. Based on these frequent itemsets, you'll find association rules that have confidence above the `min_conf` threshold."
